# DumpEdit

**A text dumping tool for AI workflows—quickly copy and paste large code blocks, error tracebacks, or log snippets without bloating your chat window.**

---

## What It Does

DumpEdit is a minimal desktop utility designed for AI and LLM users who work with:
- Long error tracebacks  
- Code snippets  
- JSON/logcat output  
- Multi-line text meant for copying and pasting into chat windows (e.g., ChatGPT)

All content is written into a single file (`DumpedEdit.txt`) that auto-saves on every change, keeping your text centralized and clean.

It also includes a **one-click “Open Folder” button**, so you can instantly access the file location and drag your text output anywhere—into ChatGPT, emails, Google Docs, or other apps. No hunting through directories.

## Why It Exists

Standard editors are bulky and too “feature-rich” for fast, repetitive pasting. DumpEdit was created to:
- Save screen space
- Avoid cluttering your AI chat
- Quickly store and reuse content without managing multiple tabs or files

---

## Planned Features (In Progress)

DumpEdit is currently text-only, but planned updates include:
- **File Drop Support:** Drag and drop `.py`, `.txt`, or `.json` files and automatically extract text
- **Multiple File Handling:** Drop multiple files and split content cleanly in the editor
- **Filename Customization:** Change the output file name from `DumpedEdit.txt` to something project-specific

These features are scoped and partially designed—coming soon once implemented.

## Usage

Just open the app, paste your content, and it's saved instantly to `DumpedEdit.txt`. Use the **Open Folder** button to instantly access the file and drag it into whatever platform you're using.
